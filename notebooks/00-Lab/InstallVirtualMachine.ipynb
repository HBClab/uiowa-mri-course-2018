    "In this lab you will be installing a Virtual Machine on your computer, allowing you run [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/), [AFNI](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/), [freesurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/), and [nipype](http://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/0.13.1/) on your computer. These are primarily the softwares that we will be using for analysis of MRI and fMRI data throughout the class. This software runs well on Linux and Mac OS X. However, it has limitations under Windows. Therefore, you will be using a Virtual Linux machine that can be run under any operating system.\n",

    "### The More You Know...\n",
    "**Q**: Why do I start counting with 0?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A**: In *most* (looking at you MATLAB) programming languages, all arrays (think of a list of items, steps like in this lab, or labs, like the labs in this repository) [start at zero](http://developeronline.blogspot.com/2008/04/why-array-index-should-start-from-0.html). So if you had a list of numbered items in your grocery list, the first item (or element) would be at index 0, not at index 1. MATLAB is the problem child because the [inventor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleve_Moler) had more background in Linear Algebra/Matrix notation, in which indexing starts at 1."
